The data to be kept by the doctor are his name, ID number and area of ​​expertise, and for a nurse his name, ID number and number of years of experience must be kept. There is also a research institute in the hospital, where researchers are working. For each researcher, the collection of articles he has written must be kept. Each article must have its publication date, the magazine name in which it was published and the name of the article. To the hospital's departments comes different patients. When a patient arrives, a business card is opened containing the information about the patient (name, ID of birth and sex), date of arrival and purpose of the visit. For each visit, anyone in the main team who handles the patient should be kept. Some doctors are surgeons, and they must also keep a number of surgeries in their area of expertise. When a patient arrives at the hospital for a visit, the visit can be either for examination or surgery, in which case the operating room number in which the operation will be conducted and whether the patient is fasting must also be kept.
